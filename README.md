## Getting started

#### Requirements

### Dev Setup

Install dependencies for server
``` bash
npm install
```

Install dependencies for client
``` bash
npm run client-install
```

Run the client and API server concurrently
``` bash
npm run dev
```

When done...
- API server will run on http://localhost:8000
- React client will run on http://localhost:3000
- Hot module reload is enabled on react client for development via webpack

You shouldn't need to, but if you want to run the API Server and React Client separately, you can do so:
```bash
npm run server
npm run client
```
